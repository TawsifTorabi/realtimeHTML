# realtimeHTML
This is basically a RealTime HTML Interpreter web application written with pure Javascript.  
I started this project when I was in school, made a rough app for my friends,  
'cause they needed something to understand HTML well.  
Use the Live App <a href="https://tawsiftorabi.github.io/realtimeHTML/">Here</a>
  
At that time,  
Table tag and Building table with HTML was a Nightmare for newbies, I donno why.  
I made this app to visually learn HTML well.  
After 5 consecutive years, while looking through my Github repositories, I looked at it again.  
So I gave it another touch to be more user-friendly and come with more functionality. Features,
